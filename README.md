# ImageResizerTokB
This program resizes your image to less than a specified number of kilobytes

V2 choses an inital reduction factor based on inital image size und lets you restart the program.

Edit: After discovering significant aliasing, I am working on an improved method. You can already download V4, but it's still beta.

I added a file to add a watermark.
