# ImageResizerTokB
This program resizes your image to less than a specified number of kilobytes

V2 choses an inital reduction factor based on inital image size und lets you restart the program. 

Charging the resizefactor (1.2) to a lower number (e.g 1.05) improves how precisely you get the desired image size, but will take longer.
